#SUMMARY
mousekips is a keyboard based mouse controller - basically, there is a layout supplied to the program that tells it how you want your keys to be arranged and then it figures out where each key fits onto your screen. 

i.e. if the layout is [ "abc", "def", "ghi" ], pressing 'a' will put the mouse cursor in the top left, b in the center left, c in the bottom left, d in the top middle, etc...

additionally, one can add movement keys that will adjust the cursor by pressing 'ctrl-key' - it's in the code, it's not really documented yet.

# DEPENDENCIES
it uses python-xlib and pygtk to do this business and may halt your computer (or make it appear so) - if that happens, switch to a virtual terminal (Ctrl-Alt-F2) and kill the process. For configuration, gconf is used.

# CONFIGURATION
mousekips uses gconf for holding configuration data (should this be changed?). Currently the keyboard layout and launch key are stored in gconf.

To set the launch key to ctrl-shift-a, use the following command in a terminal:

  gconftool -s --type string "/apps/mousekips/launch" "<Control><Shift>a"

To set the layout to qwe,asd,zxc (q is top left and c is bottom right) do:
  gconftool -s --type list --list-type string "/apps/mousekips/layout" "[qwe, asd, zxc]"

Alternatively, you can add these keys by using a graphical gconf editor, like gconf-editor
